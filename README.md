# beancount-parser [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser/tree/master)
Standalone [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) LALR(1) based Beancount syntax parser (not relying on Beancount library), MIT license

Please also checkout out [beancount-black](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black), an opinionated beancount code formatter based on beancount-parser.

## Features

- **MIT licensed** - the only dependency is [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)
- **Extremely fast** - LALR(1) is used
- **Section awareness** - emac org symbol mark `*` will be parsed
- **Comment awareness** - comments will be parsed
- **Not a validator** - it does not validate beancount syntax, invalid beancount syntax may still pass the parsing

# Sponsor

The original project beancount-parser was meant to be an internal tool built by [Launch Platform LLC](https://launchplatform.com) for

A modern accounting book service based on the most popular open source version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and text-based double entry accounting book software [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html).
We realized adding new entries with BeanHub automatically over time makes beancount file a mess.
So obviously, a strong code formatter is needed.
And to deal with comments and other corner cases, it's easier to build a parser from ground up without relying on Beancount.
While SaaS businesses won't be required to open source an internal tool like this, we still love that the service is only possible because of the open-source tool we are using.
We think it would be greatly beneficial for the community to access a tool like this, so we've decided to open source it under MIT license, hope you find this tool useful ðŸ˜„

## Install

To install the parser, simply run

```bash
pip install beancount-parser
```

## Usage

If you want to run the parse beancount code, you can do this

```python
import io

from beancount_parser.parser import make_parser

parser = make_parser()
tree = parser.parse(beancount_content)
# do whatever you want with the tree here
```
